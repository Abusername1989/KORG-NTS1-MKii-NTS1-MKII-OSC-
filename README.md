# KORG NTS 1 MKII — Custom OSC, Reverb, Delay, Modulation

This repository contains custom oscillators (osc), effects (reverb, delay, chorus) units for the KORG NTS-1 MKII ( .nts1mkiiunit). Units that are ready to import into your NTS-1 MKII. MKII????? IS THIS A DREAM? NO!!! FINALLY THERE ARE SOME CUSTOM OSC'S (FOR FREE) FOR THE NEW VERSION OF THE KORG NTS1 !!!!! SO BUY SOME DUSTWHIPES AND GRAP YOUR KORG NTS1 MKII !! 

In the beginning, I regretted not buying a second nts1mki, since there were many more oscillators available!  
I decided to start building oscillators myself. I put a lot of time into it and I'm offering everything for free! There may still be some undiscovered bugs here and there!  
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK BUT MOST IMPORTANT: HAVE FUN!! Feedback is welcome

I think you guys will appreciate this! Bring out that mkii again!  



# >>>>>>>> For those who downloaded OSCs before 13-02: OSCs and effects have been updated + a number of new OSCs and Reverb effects!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
# I haven't felt like categorizing them by effect yet. You'll figure it out when you place them on the NTS in the Editor😉
