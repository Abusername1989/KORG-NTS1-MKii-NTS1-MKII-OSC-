In the beginning, I regretted not buying a second nts1mki, since there were many more oscillators available!  
I decided to start building oscillators myself. I put a lot of time into it and I'm offering everything for free! There may still be some undiscovered bugs here and there!  
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK BUT MOST IMPORTANT: HAVE FUN!! Feedback is welcome


I think you guys will appreciate this! Bring out that mkii again!  

* I personally use the SQ1 for step sequences.
